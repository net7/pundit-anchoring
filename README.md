# Anchoring

The anchoring module was born as a Typescript rewrite of tilgovi's anchoring packages:

- https://github.com/tilgovi/dom-anchor-fragment
- https://github.com/tilgovi/dom-anchor-text-quote
- https://github.com/tilgovi/dom-anchor-text-position

The objective of this module is to provide the user with a simple API to attach web annotations to an HTML or PDF document.

To start using the anchoring module, run `npm install @pundit/anchoring`
